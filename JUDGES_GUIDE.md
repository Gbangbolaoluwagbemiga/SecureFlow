# 🏆 SecureFlow - Judges Testing Guide

## Overview

SecureFlow is a decentralized escrow platform with marketplace functionality. This guide helps hackathon judges test all features effectively.

## 🚀 Quick Start for Judges

### Option 1: Test Mode (Recommended)

1. **Connect your wallet** to the Monad Testnet
2. **Navigate to Admin page** (`/admin`)
3. **Enable "Test Mode"** - This simulates admin functions without real transactions
4. **Test all admin functionalities** safely

### Option 2: Different Wallet Testing

1. **Use a different wallet** to test non-admin user experience
2. **Test client/freelancer functionalities** from a regular user perspective

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Smart Account Features (NEW!)

- **Gasless Transactions**: Test milestone operations without gas fees
- **Batch Operations**: Execute multiple actions in single transaction
- **Delegation System**: Delegate admin functions to arbiters
- **Smart Account Demo**: Visit `/smart-account-demo` for interactive demo

### Admin Functionalities

- **Contract Pause/Unpause**: Test emergency controls
- **Dispute Resolution**: Resolve disputes between parties
- **Fee Management**: Test platform fee adjustments
- **Token Management**: Whitelist/blacklist tokens
- **Emergency Functions**: Test emergency withdrawals

#### Admin visibility after delegation (NEW)

- The Admin link appears for non-owner wallets once a delegation is created to the connected wallet.
- Access logic now checks that your connected wallet address matches the `delegatee` of any active delegation (not just that delegations exist).
- On the Smart Account Demo page, the "Create Delegation" button delegates to your currently connected wallet to simplify testing. After creating it, navigate to `/admin` to access the admin panel.

### User Functionalities

- **Job Creation**: Create escrow contracts as clients
- **Job Applications**: Apply to jobs as freelancers
- **Milestone Management**: Submit, approve, dispute milestones
- **Payment Flow**: Test the complete payment lifecycle
